# Foreword
With the release of Shadowbringers, Samurai is now celebrating two years in the game, and with Aureum's permission I'm taking over as caretaker for this guide. The 5.0 update brings with it several changes to both Samurai and melee as a whole, but due to the nature of this guide I will be introducing them for players new to the job. Please see Jahaudant's Samurai Compendium for a more in depth look at the changes from 4.X to 5.0 and further optimisations to endgame PvE on Samurai.
