<h1>Reaper: What We Know So Far</h1>
<div class=content>
<p>Reaper will be a new job coming to Final Fantasy XIV in the Endwalker expansion. As of September of 2021, we only know a few things about Reaper, and as we learn more we will update this page.</p>
<h2 id=gameplay>Gameplay<a href=#gameplay class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h2>
<p>Here are the following gameplay mechanics we know about Reaper:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will be a melee DPS</li>
<li>They will wield a Scythe as its main weapon and will use the &ldquo;Maiming&rdquo; armor, similar to DRG.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few things that can infer based on some brief video footage or what we know of other jobs:</p>
<ul>
<li>They will most likely have a positional or two. Each melee job has at least one, and it is perhaps unlikely that Reaper will be an exception.</li>
<li>They have a buff that either changes their abilities red or gives them access to a new ability. This is based on the trailer footage where the Reaper &ldquo;powers up&rdquo; and starts attacking with red streaks as opposed to the Green/Teal trails.</li>
<li>They will have a single target LB. This is most likely the Reaper LB: <a href="https://youtu.be/IkC1r0eJZ-c?t=348">https://youtu.be/IkC1r0eJZ-c?t=348</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally you can see about five Reaper abilities in this short trailer: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfqi_ow02rE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfqi_ow02rE</a></p>

<p>If you are as hyped as we are about Reaper, you may be wondering &ndash; what can I do to get ready for Reaper now? Well, generally speaking, you just want to make sure you have a level 70 Job and will need to have purchased the Endwalker expansion. There are a few other things you can do to be extra ready though! Note that these are all recommendations and none of them are required to play Reaper.</p>
<ul>
<li>Level your Dragoon and gear it up! We know that Reaper will share the same armor as Dragoon, so it will be a good idea to get that armor ready for your leveling experience. Remember that Reaper starts at level 70, so having good armor sets up to level 80 may smoothen your leveling experience.</li>
<li>Unlock Bozja and Zadnor and grind yourself up to around rank 25. Bear with me, as this may seem like a steep hill, but it isn&rsquo;t that bad. The reason you may want to have Zadnor access is because it could be the best way to level up your Reaper on release. There will be a lot players looking to level up both Reaper and Sage through dungeons, but very few tanks to fill the queues! Zadnor is an excellent leveling alternative.</li>
<li>Alternatively, form up a static to help you grind up. If you have some friends online or in your free company, perhaps you can see if one of them wants to level up a tank from 70-80 during the Endwalker release. Leveling by dungeons with rested EXP and a full party will be the fastest route to 80 on release.</li>
<li>Figure out where you can unlock Reaper in Ul&rsquo;dah and log out there! Square Enix is really good about telling us where the new jobs will be unlocked, so save yourself a minute or two and exit the game there.</li>
<li>Farm up glamours! Reaper will wear maiming gear, which means you can start farming up glamour now! When new jobs are created, Square Enix will typically introduce a weapon for that job based from the last raid fight. So if you want to have a chance at a cool looking weapon then farm up the weapon coffer, or eight pages, from Eden&rsquo;s Promise&rsquo;s final savage fight.</li>
</ul>

<p>We actually have some tidbits about Reaper Lore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Garleans' forebears were once humble farmers who made their home among the sun-drenched fields of southern Ilsabard. That was, until they were driven from this paradise by invaders wielding arcane magicks. Forced north into the frigid mountains, the survivors sought a means to tap into the reservoir of aether otherwise closed to them. A daring few found their answer within the void, binding themselves to its creatures to gain verboten power─power fed by the souls of the slain. Once more they took up their scythes, this time to reap a crimson harvest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More or less, Reapers are botanists who were tired of dealing with trouble and sold themselves to the void! Sounds pretty cool!</p>
