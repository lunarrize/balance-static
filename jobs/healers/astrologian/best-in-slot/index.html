<p>So we&rsquo;re here, finally with a proper writeup.</p>
<p>Making BiS was expected to be very difficult this tier with AST&rsquo;s new affinity for SpS&mldr;but instead it actually was quite easy. Avoid Piety like the plague and there you go, there&rsquo;s your BiS pieces.</p>
<p>Higher Piety sets also have the nice consolation of having a wealth of Crit (rather than the traditional disgusting amounts of Det) so it won&rsquo;t even feel that bad to swap to lower damage for the sake of Piety.</p>
<p>All sets are updated to include relics. If you want pre-relic stuff, it&rsquo;s in the gearcalc.</p>
<p>FAQs at the bottom. As always, keep an eye on food in the sets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Max (Reasonable) Damage Set</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Crafted) &ldquo;Fastro&rdquo; <a href=https://etro.gg/gearset/f76ddad7-1cf5-4b03-946b-cd63598157b0>https://etro.gg/gearset/f76ddad7-1cf5-4b03-946b-cd63598157b0</a><br>
(Tome) &ldquo;Almost too Fastro&rdquo; <a href=https://etro.gg/gearset/d9ba9190-5e9d-424c-ab35-617cb3101550>https://etro.gg/gearset/d9ba9190-5e9d-424c-ab35-617cb3101550</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fast. Quite fast. But this level of Piety:SpS has been tested and is very viable for all fights this tier at a high level of play. Please bring ethers with this if things go under</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Safer but still fairly fast</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Crafted) &ldquo;Need for SpellSpeed&rdquo; <a href=https://etro.gg/gearset/614d5891-6f03-4894-9802-05f0430134e6>https://etro.gg/gearset/614d5891-6f03-4894-9802-05f0430134e6</a><br>
(Tome) &ldquo;Bring home the pie&rdquo; <a href=https://etro.gg/gearset/f88f544d-eb84-4add-81b4-0bb815288054>https://etro.gg/gearset/f88f544d-eb84-4add-81b4-0bb815288054</a></p>
<p>This makes MP significantly more reasonable than the above, but still has very high damage. Bring this to situations you need a bit more MP.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Slow and safe</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Best in Sloth&rdquo; <a href=https://etro.gg/gearset/88397043-c634-4a8a-80ab-8c140244ad44>https://etro.gg/gearset/88397043-c634-4a8a-80ab-8c140244ad44</a></p>
<p>Best in Sloth, while not quite as high damage as the faster sets, is a safer option while still maintaining reasonably high damage. It is for those who have high ping and find it hard to not clip with faster GCDs, or just want to be have some extra leeway for mana during weekly re-clears.</p>

<h1 id=what-about-tea-bis>What about TEA BiS?<a href=#what-about-tea-bis class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h1>
<p>This honestly isn&rsquo;t a big deal, you can use your current gear and just go grab your Titan Savage weapon, if you can. You lose melds, sure, but it honestly isn&rsquo;t as bad as you&rsquo;d think with new food and pots.</p>
<p>But if you really do care and you think every little bit will help (which is a valid concern), then go into the spreadsheet (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mRqbJtOESUzx-hblK_CZW3Qy7MWGupD1-fbka7BJSPI/edit#gid=566495409">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mRqbJtOESUzx-hblK_CZW3Qy7MWGupD1-fbka7BJSPI/edit#gid=566495409</a>) and go to the Patch 5.0 tab. Pick either of the non-Speedkill BiS&rsquo;s you like. You don&rsquo;t need too too much Piety for TEA - especially after 5.3 - but your Bruiser phase will like you better if you take some extra Piety. If you&rsquo;re feeling spicy you can take a speedkill-level BiS and probably be okay, but the DPS check in TEA is really not that tight and it&rsquo;s much better to play it safe for these kinds of encounters.</p>
<p>Of also great note, certain pieces from The Heroes' Gauntlet are also valid pieces to take into account for your TEA BiS. The head, hands, pants, earring, and ring are all great pieces. You can mix and match as you see fit.</p>
<p>And as always, take some super-ethers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Which set do I pick?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It depends on how much Piety you need, and to a lesser extent how egregious your ping is. I play on 115ms and the 2.30 GCD works perfectly fine. I will clip very slightly in opener depending on what my cards do, and when double weaving Star after an instant, sometimes (depends how nice my tunnel is being). Single weaving Star after a Malefic has been fine. Overall this might lose me (on 115ms), maybe a GCD at worst over a fight, which getting my GCD slow enough to not do this will cost too much damage in other stats.</p>
<p>tl;dr on ping - you might clip a little, it&rsquo;s still better for your damage than alternatives</p>
<p>As for Piety, only you can know how much Piety you need. This is completely individual and dependent. For reference, the Max Damage Set works for my group in weeklies. I just bring Ethers since if a run goes South, my damage is already suboptimal so I might as well pop an Ether when my Pot CD is back up.</p>
<p>If you are a PF warrior, I recommend this tier taking a slower set with more Piety, unlike last tier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Do I use the crafted or tome ring sets?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s cute, is you can use both. There are no meld differences between the demarcated &ldquo;crafted&rdquo; and &ldquo;tome&rdquo; ring sets above. Just swap the ring.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>My gear is α, I am currently on β fight, what do I meld?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read Zyrk&rsquo;s post :arrow_up: on melding, or read the AST guide on melding. Piety to comfort (as you can tell, for high damage this usually means dodging it), Crit > SpS tiering > DH/Det</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What about TEA BiS?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scroll up! The writeup is still word-for-word valid. Bring a bit more Piety though than the Max Damage BiS has this tier for prog, Bruiser phase is very painful on MP during progression.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What about the Do Not Even Look in Here set?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did I stutter?
(No, I did not.)</p>
